Feature: Support for various data formats (structured and unstructured)
========================================================================

The system must support both structured and unstructured data. Structured data includes predefined FAQs or facts, while unstructured data encompasses PDFs, chat logs, and random documents. Currently, the reference client provides data in chat format, but the system must accommodate other formats such as Google Docs, Word files, PDFs, text files, and transcripts. The backend will be responsible for parsing these diverse formats, converting them into a common internal format, and storing them efficiently. Direct support for Excel chat formats is not planned, but guidelines will be provided for clients to export Excel data into supported formats. Initially, the system will focus on text data, meeting transcripts, and audio converted to text, with images being a potential addition later. The strategy is to begin with structured data ingestion (e.g., FAQs) and then expand to support unstructured data like free text or PDFs in later phases. Dynamic structured data, such as pricing or policy updates, will be stored in a database and updatable via an admin dashboard, triggering regeneration of embeddings. For WhatsApp integration, historical chat data can be imported via backup files from Google Drive or iCloud, allowing for analysis of trends.
