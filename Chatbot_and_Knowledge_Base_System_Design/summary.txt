Meeting: Chatbot and Knowledge Base System Design
=================================================

The meeting on 'Chatbot and Knowledge Base System Design' discussed several key points. A current issue is that a registered number for verification remains pending, delaying WhatsApp integration, though this is not an immediate blocker. The main objective is to design a pipeline for client onboarding, including defining knowledge base formats, initial ingestion, and update management. The system must support both structured data (e.g., FAQs) and unstructured data (e.g., Google Docs, Word, PDFs, text files, chat transcripts), with an internal common format for storage. While direct Excel chat parsing isn't supported, guidelines for export will be provided. The initial focus will be on text data, meeting transcripts, and audio-to-text, with images considered later. The strategy is to start with structured data ingestion, then expand to unstructured data. Around 20-40 dynamic facts (e.g., pricing) will be stored in a database and updated via an admin dashboard, triggering embedding regeneration. For WhatsApp integration, both live listening via the Business API (with data retrieval limitations) and importing historical data via backup files (enabling trend analysis) were discussed. When the chatbot cannot answer, queries should escalate to a human agent. This can be managed either by the human using WhatsApp Business directly or, preferably, through an admin dashboard. Special cases like image-based payment verification will also require human intervention. A dashboard is needed to track escalations, showing open cases, handlers, and metrics. The finalized phased approach begins with structured data ingestion, adds dynamic data updates, then supports unstructured data, provides WhatsApp integration, and finally implements a transparent human escalation system.
