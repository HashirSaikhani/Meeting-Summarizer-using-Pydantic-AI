Feature: WhatsApp integration (live listening and historical data import)
==========================================================================

For WhatsApp integration, two main approaches are being considered. The first is live listening via the WhatsApp Business API, though this is limited by WhatsApp's restrictions, typically only allowing retrieval of data for the past six months. The second approach involves importing historical data through backup files from sources like Google Drive or iCloud, which permits the import of all historical messages at once. After importing, the system can filter and clean outdated or irrelevant messages. This method also allows for the analysis of seasonality and trends if a client provides extensive chat backups (e.g., a year's worth). 

Related to WhatsApp, the system needs to support data from chat logs, which can be provided either directly or through WhatsApp. In cases where clients cannot provide exports, the system may need to listen directly to their chat systems, though this functionality will remain optional and can be added later. 

Furthermore, WhatsApp is central to the human escalation process. When the chatbot cannot answer a query, it should escalate to a human agent who replies using the same WhatsApp interface, ensuring the end-user does not perceive a switch from bot to human. This can be achieved either by the human manually using WhatsApp Business with real-time conversation syncing with our system, or preferably, by the human using our admin dashboard to view and reply to escalated queries, with the backend sending responses via the WhatsApp API. 

In summary, the plan includes providing WhatsApp integration through both live listening and backup imports as part of a phased approach to the chatbot's evolution.
