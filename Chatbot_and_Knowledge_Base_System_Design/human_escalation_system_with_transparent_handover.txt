Feature: Human escalation system with transparent handover
===========================================================

The human escalation system is designed to provide a transparent handover to a human agent when the chatbot cannot answer a query. The end-user will not realize they have switched from bot to human, as the human agent will reply using the same WhatsApp interface. There are two proposed methods for human replies: either the human uses WhatsApp Business manually with real-time conversation syncing, or, preferably, the human uses an admin dashboard to view escalated queries and reply directly through it, with responses sent via the WhatsApp API.

Special cases, such as payment verification via receipt images, will also trigger an escalation to a human accountant. A dedicated dashboard will be maintained to track escalations, displaying open cases, assigned handlers, and reporting metrics such as daily escalations and average response times. This system will be managed through a dashboard as part of the overall flow.
