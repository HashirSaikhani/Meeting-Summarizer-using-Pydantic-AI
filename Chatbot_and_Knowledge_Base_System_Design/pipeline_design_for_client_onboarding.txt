Feature: Pipeline design for client onboarding
===============================================

The main objective is to design a pipeline for new client onboarding that defines how deployment is handled, what formats their knowledge base will be in, how initial ingestion occurs, and how subsequent updates are managed. The pipeline must support various data formats, including Google Docs, Word files, PDFs, text files, and transcripts, encompassing both structured (FAQs) and unstructured data (PDFs, chat logs). The backend will parse these formats, convert them into a common internal format, and store them efficiently. While direct Excel chat support isn't available, guidelines for exporting Excel data will be provided. Clients are expected to provide data through documents (Word, PDFs) or chat logs (directly or via WhatsApp), with an optional future capability to listen directly to chat systems. Initially, the system will focus on text data, meeting transcripts, and audio converted to text. The ingestion strategy will begin with structured data and later expand to unstructured data. For dynamic facts that change periodically (e.g., pricing), these will be stored in a database and updated via a simple admin dashboard, triggering embedding regeneration. WhatsApp integration for data will involve two approaches: live listening via the WhatsApp Business API (limited to 6 months data) and importing historical data from backup files (Google Drive, iCloud) for comprehensive analysis. The overall flow follows a phased approach: structured data ingestion, dynamic data updates, unstructured data support, and WhatsApp integration for data handling.
