Feature: Backend for data parsing, conversion, and storage
===========================================================

The backend is crucial for a robust data pipeline, starting with new client onboarding. It must support diverse formats like Google Docs, Word files, PDFs, text files, and transcripts, handling both structured data (FAQs, facts) and unstructured data (PDFs, chat logs). Key responsibilities include parsing these formats, converting them into a common internal format, and storing them efficiently. Direct Excel parsing is not supported, so clients will be advised to export data into supported formats. The initial focus will be on text data, meeting transcripts, and audio converted to text, with images considered later. The ingestion strategy prioritizes structured data first, expanding to unstructured data in later phases. Dynamic facts (e.g., pricing, schedules) will be stored in the database, updated via an admin dashboard, and changes will trigger regeneration of embeddings for real-time accuracy. For WhatsApp integration, the backend will facilitate importing historical chat data from backups (Google Drive, iCloud) for cleaning, filtering, and trend analysis.
