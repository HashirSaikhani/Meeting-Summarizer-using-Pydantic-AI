Feature: Unstructured data ingestion
=====================================

The system needs to support unstructured data, including formats such as Google Docs, Word files, PDFs, text files, and transcripts, in addition to structured data. The backend will be responsible for parsing these various unstructured formats, converting them into a common internal format, and storing them efficiently. While Excel chats are not directly supported for parsing, guidelines can be provided for clients to export Excel data into a supported format. Initially, the focus will be on text data, meeting transcripts, audio converted to text, and potentially images later on. The ChatDocs app currently works with unstructured data using RAG. However, the strategy for this new system is to start with structured data ingestion first and then expand to support unstructured data like free text or PDFs in later phases. For WhatsApp integration, importing historical data from backup files (Google Drive or iCloud) allows for analyzing unstructured chat history.
