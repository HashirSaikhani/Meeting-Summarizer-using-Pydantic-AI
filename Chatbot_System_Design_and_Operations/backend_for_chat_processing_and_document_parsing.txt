Feature: Backend for chat processing and document parsing
==========================================================

The backend will handle all chat processing and document parsing. It will be designed to ingest various document formats like Google Docs, Word, and PDF, transcribing them for uniform processing. For chat, it will handle parsing and conversion. It will also manage the ingestion and conversion of multiple documents into a common format, explicitly noting that Excel chat is not directly supported but Excel data can be sent to a person. The backend will support various data types including Excel, PDF, text, and meeting transcripts, acting as a general data registration system. It aims to process structured data to extract deterministic information. The backend will also be responsible for processing audio messages by transcribing them to text, and for video, it will extract and process the audio as text, while initially ignoring the video content itself. It will implement configurable rate limits for text, audio, images, and video messages, and set limits on document size (e.g., 1000 pages). It will store and manage static and dynamic information fetched from a database using a function calling mechanism. The backend will also incorporate checks for similarity scores for incoming messages, flagging or ignoring irrelevant content, and handling repeated queries by potentially blocking users for a period. It will maintain stack information that auto-updates and supports configurable review cycles for new knowledge ingestion, ensuring old data is retained but new data does not overlap.
