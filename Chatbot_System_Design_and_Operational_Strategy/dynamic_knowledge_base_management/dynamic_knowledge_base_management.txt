Main Feature: Dynamic Knowledge Base Management
================================================

Initially our static information will remain, dynamic information which we expect, say, 25 or 40 cases expected, which will be dynamic content, then from DB fetch, ok, and function calling mechanism, tools, those are tools, ok, ok, ok, one or two things done, ingestion full discussion done, just one thought, any ambiguity remains, ok, ok, now whatever on testing per client, whatever prompt comes, it determines intent, some goes to right owner, some I respond from my knowledge, to say hello, its inner logic is inner tool, ok, obviously it is hello response, for your new helpers etc., where knowledge base Q&A comes, if similarity score very low, then it escalates to human, and if repeated attempt fails, it escalates to human, the intent is taken that it has been understood, we have metric timing, yes, we are not satisfied, if escalates to human, now...

We made a prototype for you, yes, we made it. We have done quite a few factor similarity scores on top, but we made the full prototype. How this is going, this intervention recognition is going in this way. We made a flow diagram for it. It was made, you made it, good scripting pointer, and uploaded in one role. Uploaded in it. Can it also give us web server links? But we will have to poll. Initially, we say that as your rates get updated, update the responsibility infusion in your database. In the next phase, we will definitely commit this too, but the thing is, we can scrape and fetch latest rates ourselves, latest attempts, because this is scheduled, public schedule, which exam’s schedule is wanted. Another thing, which information we have registered in the FAX, which is also server-side, we need to make protocol for them that they review their respective information individually. But questions get lost. I had given a scheduler, my August, my papers’ exam scheduler given, August passed, name came, but exam given. But the data is present, data is present. August passed, music if done, rest is late, came to us. When we say data has arrived, because function comes in application, we can trigger it manually. Exactly, the reminders and fallback to human escalation, both will push, so human gets so many queries, they will answer. Update us what human is doing.

Yes, then we will have to, we were told that old data was mixing with our responses, there was such face information in it, for old semester separated, for new separated, data will not be lost, it will grow big, in it intent or whatever system we have to make, we will know, that some questions are every 3 months, every 6 months, whose answers should be, this is precisely we need to see, this dynamic information, it will become automatic through LLM, absolutely through LLM, we do not have to supervise it, its precise thing is that these questions, their answer we need to fetch, because rates are, they fetch some questions’ answer, data master we have, whole data, if someone wants to do, but dynamic, someone easily wants, and dynamic also shows in Excel, exactly, if any master updates any of these, then it should have an interface, give them option on interface, in it could be that we have some acts in the system, that basically business how runs, we will know what we have, but some information or expects they need to feed, if they need to feed, yes, give them a form on dashboard, which fills from our data piece and displays, they update, and when update, press a push button, it goes, converts to embed, and updates old embed again, ok, this information we need, through function calling, what things we should not do, no, through function calling, meaning, what we need, we need that at this time, whatever a particular course rate is, in our database in one place, this defined function exists, and it will not be too many functions, 20-30-40 facts, which over time change, dynamic things we need in DB, things which we tell it, that which information you need, it will tell, also it will provide, also in training form how we do in DB, for persistence attach in memory, further max types, discuss, one is text message, one is audio message, images, some last, there requirement was that when user pressed high, we message, that this pressed route, then with images, etc., designed posters, we can say yes, we posted it, brochures, if here I posted a lot, then keep posting repeatedly, this is exactly, Oscar, if I say, for my one ORD and one ART, then only that should go, it is not that, this is its theoretical, many things, this second phase, no, ok, initial is that system enter will be, what we need to do first, initially our static information will remain, dynamic information which we expect, say, 25 or 40 cases expected, which will be dynamic content, then from DB fetch, ok, and function calling mechanism, tools, those are tools, ok, ok, ok, one or two things done, ingestion full discussion done, just one thought, any ambiguity remains, ok, ok, now whatever on testing per client, whatever prompt comes, it determines intent, some goes to right owner, some I respond from my knowledge, to say hello, its inner logic is inner tool, ok, obviously it is hello response, for your new helpers etc., where knowledge base Q&A comes, if similarity score very low, then it escalates to human, and if repeated attempt fails, it escalates to human, the intent is taken that it has been understood, we have metric timing, yes, we are not satisfied, if escalates to human, now...

It will have a knowledge base, static and dynamic. When you check it, you can see the full data, review it, configure the dynamic knowledge base’s variety. By default, assume one entity, but it can be configured.

Multi-tenancy: multiple knowledge bases exist but a unique deployment. Escalation and related processes follow a fixed guideline; the user understands. Even if it’s single-tenant, we have to consider maximum services per tenant. That’s business: we set limits and charge accordingly. The service may have limits: maximum instances it can serve, each with a master service, a second service, a third, etc. They can adjust or scale it; our cause grows with that. For now, we can set constraints based on members. We decide how many integrations can be done, who can handle which instances. The system will transparently manage escalations, constraints, and service assignments.

When we give the system text input, it informs us of all new and existing system data. Our manager, Shams, insists that the bot should not be confused—it should behave clearly, like Mustafa. Security and audit are partially implemented. Dashboard: new messages come in, and the system handles them according to defined rules, ensuring rate limits, message type constraints, and processing priorities are maintained for text, audio, images, and video.

Regarding new information, there should be a review cycle—one or two weeks, configurable. For example, if we collect facts or knowledge, we ingest it and after review, concrete information is approved and added to the system. We may keep raw information for two weeks, and after four weeks, reprocess it to update the text while preserving previous context. Old data is retained but new ingestion should not overlap old data.

If similar information comes in, the system must identify whether it is an already asked question or a new question on a similar topic. For highly relevant facts, we check similarities; if four or five facts match closely, they may be marked as duplicates. A mechanism must be built to handle this dynamically. Scheduled updates will occur in panels but are not fully automatic—user input is needed for dynamic adjustments.

Stack information is stored and auto-updated. Users can configure whether new reviews are done automatically or at initial review level. New information will appear on the dashboard, and automation can be enabled later once confidence levels are satisfactory.

Regarding the dashboard analytics: it should display topics, frequency, matches, and trends in messages and interactions, providing insights on message relevance, new questions, and similarity patterns.
