   --- Integration with Business Accounts (e.g., WhatsApp Business API)
====================================================================================

But my suggestion is, if we can poll selectively, just poll selectively, will not trouble them much, that this is a human, we will not disturb much, that’s it, right, good API, I was seeing, it said, for API, you can extract messages up to six months, backup also option, yes, so our own, we saw, if we integrate with them, business account, why not make API account, I also will, it is fine, we get access to a business account, so differently, we can poll its name, does it have a business account, will that be ok, that they share with us, all chats of this account go into ours, they go, number not change, yes, correct, can share from right, mobile full backup happens, if they with mobile, share backup only, then in ours single backup comes, they do not want to set one, do not set, I will, they will poll the case, generally, what does WhatsApp say, I don’t know, it does not tell, API app what read, you told, but WhatsApp generally says, we do not keep your messages, basically they only keep messages for transfer, really all messages where are, iCloud, only two told, API app, if in your Google Drive backup, share the files backed up, in this way, normally on Android, when thinking from old phone, first I support, one file comes out, that file I then do myself, so from single file, whole backup done, if such people show, your file, we manage in maintenance, all data, from it, also tells that your data, should be in file, then it is clear, so option we will give and explain, same that we will listen also.
I remember they said we have WhatsApp login numbers, backup with them.
The humans will be sitting with WhatsApp sessions; they will be inside a group. They will escalate there. No, no, I get it. Look, the number we are replying from, the human also sees the same. Yes, they are replying. So, they can reply using the same WhatsApp Business account user interface. They are replying there. When we escalate, the human will not reply automatically until they themselves respond to the message. Until they give a human answer. Right, that’s how it is. So we also consider it in the same group. My question also came: account series and ongoing tasks. In the same group, my admin is also there. Admin is also there. I add one more admin and do it this way. No, no, we don’t want group conversation; API doesn’t support group conversation. It’s one-to-one, but one-to-one conversation is sensitive, known to the person. So, human escalations will be given enough points or information so the person can identify and act. Once they process, they will know. And in chat, I have to track and reach the chat where the discussion is happening. Right? Obviously, many users can come. One way is this. Another thought: should we have a separate dashboard for escalations? To know how many escalations happened. In one day, attended users. Same came, same came. I also received, many came to the group. No, no, they have a number, and they do one-to-one messages. Suppose your number, I send a message; the person comes for payment. Now the chatbot gets an image: “I have made payment.” Ok. I cannot verify myself because I don’t have account access. They have account number. They check and confirm: “Yes, money received from X.” They will say yes.
They will log in on laptop to WhatsApp business account, search chat, and reply from there. Full view of escalations from dashboard. Reason: otherwise, person would manually search chat from laptop and reply. API should know the context: if already replied, small poll in chat session tracks who replied. The dashboard user is replying via API. When they click, API forwards the message: “Yes, message received, payment verified.” Each client may have multiple numbers; if a client has four numbers, e.g., in the company, each stream is...
Another option could be that they say, WhatsApp charged me, and I reply to the WhatsApp charged message; this is the reality. It’s very complicated. I tell you why it’s complicated: let’s say 3–4 complaints are gathered, we have to tell the user to select that chat and respond to it, support one-to-one escalation. That will be difficult. It can’t be done with them; it would be cluttered, so we will choose. One small thing: keep in mind that the WhatsApp Business Account gets updated; these few things, BSPs (Business Solution Providers) say, they provide on their Meta web service. This is in my solution providers queue; this is the cap, shipped 365 days, so for five thousand active users maximum, we had calculated. It can handle with them, and what happens at twenty thousand? That’s another big complexity.
