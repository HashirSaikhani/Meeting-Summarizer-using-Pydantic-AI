   --- Structured Data Registration
================================================

we are registering data, so our chat docs in it, see registered, that general registration of our application, chat docs, they register at high abstract or channel level, not very specific structured semi, I would rather say fully structured, because structured data, you have deterministic, that category is, that not to put in case opinion initially, so we get structured information, whatever structure comes, then we can also put in opinion as we like, we have to put, yes exactly, first we need to make comprehensive type facts, frequent here ask question, which unstructured data is, we also have structured data, in it chunking we do not need to do, just like that, right, when facts go forward, then the answer will come, it is better or simple, then its pre-concerns, we will do support for all, we may also integrate some from it, in way like Merhab, pivot word, at least the text and listening inside chat board, we donâ€™t know, tech also can cast it, in which we inspire it and it will listen, your mosque, mutual says, it listens secretly, context out is like that, it says, we can extract bulk export, if we had to give, bulk export way, no, okay, we checked, so we did research, I did not see myself, so some way we can extract, see if we start now, for three months listen, what comes to us from past six months or year, can extract, very insightful, it has seen full season, all seasons, means 365 days cycle, it saw, from that my belief, we can get very good insights, so we do a parallel activity on it, keep other assets.
Another thing, which information we have registered in the FAX, which is also server-side, we need to make protocol for them that they review their respective information individually.
