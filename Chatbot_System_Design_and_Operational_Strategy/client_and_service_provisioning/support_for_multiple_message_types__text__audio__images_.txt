   -- Support for Multiple Message Types (Text, Audio, Images)
============================================================================

further max types, discuss, one is text message, one is audio message, images, some last, there requirement was that when user pressed high, we message, that this pressed route, then with images, etc., designed posters, we can say yes, we posted it, brochures, if here I posted a lot, then keep posting repeatedly, this is exactly, Oscar, if I say, for my one ORD and one ART, then only that should go, it is not that, this is its theoretical, many things, this second phase, no, ok, initial is that system enter will be, what we need to do first, initially our static information will remain, dynamic information which we expect, say, 25 or 40 cases expected, which will be dynamic content, then from DB fetch, ok, and function calling mechanism, tools, those are tools, ok, ok, ok, one or two things done, ingestion full discussion done, just one thought, any ambiguity remains, ok, ok, now whatever on testing per client, whatever prompt comes, it determines intent, some goes to right owner, some I respond from my knowledge, to say hello, its inner logic is inner tool, ok, obviously it is hello response, for your new helpers etc., where knowledge base Q&A comes, if similarity score very low, then it escalates to human, and if repeated attempt fails, it escalates to human, the intent is taken that it has been understood, we have metric timing, yes, we are not satisfied, if escalates to human, now...
For example, if image comes like a payment. They did payment, we said it’s retail work. They sent image confirming payment. Now, human access is not visible; someone has to verify. Then we need to tell them it is ok, received. Amount received, confirmed. If a question arises, human must consider it. But human escalation—what does it mean? Escalation to human: human doesn’t have different contact numbers; student communicates from same number. I remember they said we have WhatsApp login numbers, backup with them.
Now the chatbot gets an image: “I have made payment.” Ok. I cannot verify myself because I don’t have account access. They have account number. They check and confirm: “Yes, money received from X.” They will say yes.
However, in edge behavior, it remains. For threads, we have identification: we pick that thread. All our discussions will happen. Also, some human escalations, we will explicitly determine: as they said, “I want to talk to a person.” I have to connect them to a person. They are continuously sending messages, we have to understand what they are asking, but we may not be able to answer. Some data we don’t have understanding of; we need to transcribe and understand it to reply. Audio, yes, we need to handle; minutes should be considered. Audio: I mean the data coming, we need to have our mechanism for the received data, what action to take. Do we need direct human escalation? If an image comes, we view it and escalate if needed. Maybe the human shouldn’t intervene, but we need to determine which human gets it assigned. Could be one, two, or three, with different timings. This is a very good feature: assign back, timing-based. Then if escalation occurs and no reply comes within an hour, two hours, or certain minutes, and someone else needs to respond, we have to separately track this module. But overall, we should estimate how many escalation attempts there will be. Another thing: escalation randomization, maybe 24-hour window. Suppose a human is on duty; we’ve assumed we picked the window, from this time to that time…
Now, about human escalation: some things will occur that cannot be forwarded with images or such. There might be questions that must be answered by a human. The human will respond, and it will become part of that subthread; the human takes ownership. Yes, this will be the takeover. What happens is that if escalation occurs and there’s a ticket, what happens to that ticket? Yes, the escalation gets closed, then the chatbot takes back control. Until this is done, if a ticket has been generated, after generating the ticket, should the chatbot continue to handle it alongside? My point is that until the person who received the escalation…
