======================================================

but I expect that someone’s doc will be Google Doc, someone’s Word, someone’s PDF, so I can also transcribe, for us, all things same
Some data we don’t have understanding of; we need to transcribe and understand it to reply. Audio, yes, we need to handle; minutes should be considered.
Audio: I mean the data coming, we need to have our mechanism for the received data, what action to take.
