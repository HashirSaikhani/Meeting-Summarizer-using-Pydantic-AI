but I expect that someone’s doc will be Google Doc, someone’s Word, someone’s PDF, so I can also transcribe, for us, all things same, we can see what we will get, like some documents and structured comments, and in our system there will be mechanism to upload in multiple documents and convert to co-fax, okay, in this Excel chat cannot happen, yes, in this Excel chat cannot happen, so our backend will do all the work, chat will be like some parsed, and documents will be seen, but one thing in my mind can happen, your thing, that some docs are dropped, but I also, one done step, in it manual may be, so to make it easy, we write multi-sent, that Excel data, send to person, we have sent to client, took it, if Excel support not given, suppose, because in which format will Excel be, exactly its interpretation, why in Excel we said sorry, people maintain in Excel sometimes, and that data for entry fee and it was given by Reki, it happened like that, design complete, so tell that Excel also important, so we say no, whatever raw data you give, you have to give in this form, or this document is Word, you have to fill, whatever position not listed, till what we can do, majority cases can do, what we expect that majority client side, definitely client side, meaning first client exception, that they say I have nothing, I will give chats, then say no, I cannot give chats either, that is overhead, listen on our chats, okay, so even on event chats, listening feature also exists, okay, we will listen, we broad set give, we say...
We say that Excel, all this is not necessary that we integrate as-is and implement, therefore support we will put in backend, we will say we will do it in re-requirements that yes, this Excel PDF/text/meeting transcript, whatever Google backup, everything, support easily, basically we are registering data, so our chat docs in it, see registered, that general registration of our application, chat docs, they register at high abstract or channel level, not very specific structured semi, I would rather say fully structured, because structured data, you have deterministic, that category is, that not to put in case opinion initially, so we get structured information, whatever structure comes, then we can also put in opinion as we like, we have to put, yes exactly, first we need to make comprehensive type facts, frequent here ask question, which unstructured data is, we also have structured data, in it chunking we do not need to do, just like that, right, when facts go forward, then the answer will come, it is better or simple, then its pre-concerns, we will do support for all, we may also integrate some from it, in way like Merhab, pivot word, at least the text and listening inside chat board, we don’t know, tech also can cast it, in which we inspire it and it will listen, your mosque, mutual says, it listens secretly, context out is like that, it says, we can extract bulk export, if we had to give, bulk export way, no, okay, we checked, so we did research, I did not see myself, so some way we can extract, see if we start now, for three months listen, what comes to us from past six months or year, can extract, very insightful, it has seen full season, all seasons, means 365 days cycle, it saw, from that my belief, we can get very good insights, so we do a parallel activity on it, keep other assets.
But my suggestion is, if we can poll selectively, just poll selectively, will not trouble them much, that this is a human, we will not disturb much, that’s it, right, good API, I was seeing, it said, for API, you can extract messages up to six months, backup also option, yes, so our own, we saw, if we integrate with them, business account, why not make API account, I also will, it is fine, we get access to a business account, so differently, we can poll its name, does it have a business account, will that be ok, that they share with us, all chats of this account go into ours, they go, number not change, yes, correct, can share from right, mobile full backup happens, if they with mobile, share backup only, then in ours single backup comes, they do not want to set one, do not set, I will, they will poll the case, generally, what does WhatsApp say, I don’t know, it does not tell, API app what read, you told, but WhatsApp generally says, we do not keep your messages, basically they only keep messages for transfer, really all messages where are, iCloud, only two told, API app, if in your Google Drive backup, share the files backed up, in this way, normally on Android, when thinking from old phone, first I support, one file comes out, that file I then do myself, so from single file, whole backup done, if such people show, your file, we manage in maintenance, all data, from it, also tells that your data, should be in file, then it is clear, so option we will give and explain, same that we will listen also.
We will listen, but all your seasons’ data is in it, so we will get old data from it, then we will have to filter it out, yes, then we will have to, we were told that old data was mixing with our responses, there was such face information in it, for old semester separated, for new separated, data will not be lost, it will grow big, in it intent or whatever system we have to make, we will know, that some questions are every 3 months, every 6 months, whose answers should be, this is precisely we need to see, this dynamic information, it will become automatic through LLM, absolutely through LLM, we do not have to supervise it, its precise thing is that these questions, their answer we need to fetch, because rates are, they fetch some questions’ answer, data master we have, whole data, if someone wants to do, but dynamic, someone easily wants, and dynamic also shows in Excel, exactly, if any master updates any of these, then it should have an interface, give them option on interface, in it could be that we have some acts in the system, that basically business how runs, we will know what we have, but some information or expects they need to feed, if they need to feed, yes, give them a form on dashboard, which fills from our data piece and displays, they update, and when update, press a push button, it goes, converts to embed, and updates old embed again, ok, this information we need, through function calling, what things we should not do, no, through function calling, meaning, what we need, we need that at this time, whatever a particular course rate is, in our database in one place, this defined function exists, and it will not be too many functions, 20-30-40 facts, which over time change, dynamic things we need in DB, things which we tell it, that which information you need, it will tell, also it will provide, also in training form how we do in DB, for persistence attach in memory, further max types, discuss, one is text message, one is audio message, images, some last, there requirement was that when user pressed high, we message, that this pressed route, then with images, etc., designed posters, we can say yes, we posted it, brochures, if here I posted a lot, then keep posting repeatedly, this is exactly, Oscar, if I say, for my one ORD and one ART, then only that should go, it is not that, this is its theoretical, many things, this second phase, no, ok, initial is that system enter will be, what we need to do first, initially our static information will remain, dynamic information which we expect, say, 25 or 40 cases expected, which will be dynamic content, then from DB fetch, ok, and function calling mechanism, tools, those are tools, ok, ok, ok, one or two things done, ingestion full discussion done, just one thought, any ambiguity remains, ok, ok, now whatever on testing per client, whatever prompt comes, it determines intent, some goes to right owner, some I respond from my knowledge, to say hello, its inner logic is inner tool, ok, obviously it is hello response, for your new helpers etc., where knowledge base Q&A comes, if similarity score very low, then it escalates to human, and if repeated attempt fails, it escalates to human, the intent is taken that it has been understood, we have metric timing, yes, we are not satisfied, if escalates to human, now...
We can scrape and fetch latest rates ourselves, latest attempts, because this is scheduled, public schedule, which exam’s schedule is wanted. Another thing, which information we have registered in the FAX, which is also server-side, we need to make protocol for them that they review their respective information individually. But questions get lost. I had given a scheduler, my August, my papers’ exam scheduler given, August passed, name came, but exam given. But the data is present, data is present. August passed, music if done, rest is late, came to us. When we say data has arrived, because function comes in application, we can trigger it manually. Exactly, the reminders and fallback to human escalation, both will push, so human gets so many queries, they will answer. Update us what human is doing.
The humans will be sitting with WhatsApp sessions; they will be inside a group. They will escalate there. No, no, I get it. Look, the number we are replying from, the human also sees the same. Yes, they are replying. So, they can reply using the same WhatsApp Business account user interface. They are replying there. When we escalate, the human will not reply automatically until they themselves respond to the message. Until they give a human answer. Right, that’s how it is. So we also consider it in the same group. My question also came: account series and ongoing tasks. In the same group, my admin is also there. Admin is also there. I add one more admin and do it this way. No, no, we don’t want group conversation; API doesn’t support group conversation. It’s one-to-one, but one-to-one conversation is sensitive, known to the person. So, human escalations will be given enough points or information so the person can identify and act. Once they process, they will know. And in chat, I have to track and reach the chat where the discussion is happening. Right? Obviously, many users can come. One way is this. Another thought: should we have a separate dashboard for escalations? To know how many escalations happened. In one day, attended users. Same came, same came. I also received, many came to the group. No, no, they have a number, and they do one-to-one messages. Suppose your number, I send a message; the person comes for payment. Now the chatbot gets an image: “I have made payment.” Ok. I cannot verify myself because I don’t have account access. They have account number. They check and confirm: “Yes, money received from X.” They will say yes.
Also, they have an online account portal, they activate it. “Ok, I got a receipt. Is it payment confirmed?” I had the accountant number; they forward on that number or send text/WhatsApp. But they notify: go to dashboard for human escalation. I created a separate category for human escalation: 10 messages, escalated by human. They address these 10, so no need to go to WhatsApp. They will log in on laptop to WhatsApp business account, search chat, and reply from there. Full view of escalations from dashboard. Reason: otherwise, person would manually search chat from laptop and reply. API should know the context: if already replied, small poll in chat session tracks who replied. The dashboard user is replying via API. When they click, API forwards the message: “Yes, message received, payment verified.” Each client may have multiple numbers; if a client has four numbers, e.g., in the company, each stream is...
One small thing: keep in mind that the WhatsApp Business Account gets updated; these few things, BSPs (Business Solution Providers) say, they provide on their Meta web service. This is in my solution providers queue; this is the cap, shipped 365 days, so for five thousand active users maximum, we had calculated. It can handle with them, and what happens at twenty thousand? That’s another big complexity.
