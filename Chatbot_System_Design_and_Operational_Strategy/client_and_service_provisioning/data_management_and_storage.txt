===============================================

in our system there will be mechanism to upload in multiple documents and convert to co-fax
basically we are registering data, so our chat docs in it, see registered, that general registration of our application, chat docs, they register at high abstract or channel level, not very specific structured semi, I would rather say fully structured, because structured data, you have deterministic, that category is, that not to put in case opinion initially, so we get structured information, whatever structure comes, then we can also put in opinion as we like, we have to put, yes exactly, first we need to make comprehensive type facts, frequent here ask question, which unstructured data is, we also have structured data, in it chunking we do not need to do, just like that, right, when facts go forward, then the answer will come, it is better or simple, then its pre-concerns, we will do support for all
Initially our static information will remain, dynamic information which we expect, say, 25 or 40 cases expected, which will be dynamic content, then from DB fetch
give them option on interface, in it could be that we have some acts in the system, that basically business how runs, we will know what we have, but some information or expects they need to feed, if they need to feed, yes, give them a form on dashboard, which fills from our data piece and displays, they update, and when update, press a push button, it goes, converts to embed, and updates old embed again
We also need to keep those things in mind, whatever a particular course rate is, in our database in one place, this defined function exists, and it will not be too many functions, 20-30-40 facts, which over time change, dynamic things we need in DB, things which we tell it, that which information you need, it will tell, also it will provide, also in training form how we do in DB, for persistence attach in memory
What comes to us from past six months or year, can extract, very insightful, it has seen full season, all seasons, means 365 days cycle, it saw, from that my belief, we can get very good insights, so we do a parallel activity on it, keep other assets.
We will listen, but all your seasonsâ€™ data is in it, so we will get old data from it, then we will have to filter it out, yes, then we will have to, we were told that old data was mixing with our responses, there was such face information in it, for old semester separated, for new separated, data will not be lost, it will grow big, in it intent or whatever system we have to make, we will know
