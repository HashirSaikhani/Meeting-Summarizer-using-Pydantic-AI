Main Feature: Performance Analytics and Insights
=================================================

Regarding the dashboard analytics: it should display topics, frequency, matches, and trends in messages and interactions, providing insights on message relevance, new questions, and similarity patterns.
We will also include this in the matching process for support bars, escalation, verification in the dashboard, backup, and release tracking. We need to monitor this carefully. The flow is as follows: it includes module flow, dashboard checklists, and monitoring support activities. For the website, we need to track all user interactions, and in the dashboard, we should be able to view them together. There is an option for support and comparison reports.
If an email is sent, the information will still be recorded and reflected on the dashboard for insights. We need to determine how much raw information to store. For example, if a user asks a question and receives a successful answer, we can analyze it at the end of the day to calculate a success rate. We also determine session termination: if we reply and the user does not respond within 24 hours, or after four hours intervals, the session is considered complete. We calculate satisfaction or quality rating per session.
We also track the user's mobile number for the data, including the duration and all related information. This helps in generating metrics and statistics. The system should handle 24-hour activity windows. Short windows of response exist, but if support responds quickly, the user can also follow up. Escalated queries are handled after the escalation process.
